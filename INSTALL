GLtron - Installation from source

If you install from CVS, read also README.CVS

Requirements:

Get a working OpenGL / Mesa installation
Get libpng / zlib (standard on almost any system)
Get SDL-1.2 (1.1 might work, but is unsupported)

If you want sound, you need to grab SDL_sound 0.1.4 or later from
http://icculus.org/SDL_sound/

Required libraries for SDL_sound: libmikmod 3.1.5 or newer, libvorbis
for ogg/vorbis support and smpeg for mp3 support. Your average distribution
has most of them already installed (except maybe smpeg).

Compiling

./configure
make

Type './gltron' to play!

You can install the data files (folders art/ and data/) into any directory,
as long as you put the executable in the same directory as art/ and data/
Thenput a symlink in /usr/local/bin or somewhere else in your $PATH
and you're done.

'gltron -h' lists a few options. Most notably is the -O option, which will
speed things up greatly *if you don't have a 3D card*. Don't use this
unless the game runs really slow, the visuals will suffer terribly.

Start gltron with the -s option if you don't want the sound playing.
