Installation (general things).

for URL's on how to get these packages see
http://www.ards.net/Andreas/gltron.html#links

Get a working OpenGL / Mesa
Get Glut (glut is in the MesaDemos package)

Installation (without sound)

% make
% ./gltron

Installation (with sound)

Get libmikmod and install it

% make sound
% ./gltron

STOP: make install is currently broken!

Optionally:

% su
# make install

will install gltron in GLTRON_INSTALLDIR and gltron.it (if present),
settings.txt, menu.txt, helvetica.txf in GLTRON_HOME as defined in the
Makefile.  By default, GLTRON_INSTALLDIR is /usr/bin and
GLTRON_HOME is /usr/share/games/gltron.

gltron will look for the following files:

gltron.it (only if compiled with sound)
settings.txt menu.txt gltron.sgi gltron_floor.sgi gltron_wall.sgi
xenotron.ftx xenotron.0.sgi xenotron.1.sgi t-u-low.obj tron.mtl

If the environment variable GLTRON_HOME is defined, it will look
there first, ./ second, /usr/share/games/gltron third and at last in
/usr/local/share/games/gltron. If you do a make install and have changed
GLTRON_HOME, you _must_ set the GLTRON_HOME environment variable.

You might also want to put the GLTRON_HOME environment variable into
your ~/.profile (bash) or ~/.tcshrc (tcsh).

Start gltron with the -s option if you don't want the sound playing.

These instructions are very brief. I'd be glad if someone could write
them better.
